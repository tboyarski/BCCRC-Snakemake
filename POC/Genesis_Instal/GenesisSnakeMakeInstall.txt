Using Anaconda, to install and support Python and SnakeMake, requires that certain versions be chosen.
Many Anaconda packages are version specific; typically they are only compatible with a single version of Python.
What that in mind, often, a package will be offered as a "series", with a new version for each Python version.

This installation guide will be with respect to AnaConda, and it assumes you already have Anaconda installed.

    Key Conda Phrases:
	conda info --env
	conda create -n <envName> python=1.2.3 anaconda
	source activate <envName>
	conda install <packageName>
	source deactivate

1) Understand the specifications of the environment you wish to create. It is often important to check the 
    Python versions required to support the package you are interested in. This is somewhat problematic for 
    the following reasons:
	1) Only a sub-set of Conda packages are provided by default, via channel defaults.
	2) It is difficult to determine Python version requires of packages using a web-browser.

2) Add the channels you wish to download from, to the Conda installation.
	E.g.	conda config --add channels <channelName>
    
	I reccomend adding the following channels:
		conda config --add channels johanneskoester
		conda config --add channels conda-forge
		conda config --add channels r
		conda config --add channels biomake

3) Search for the package's you are interested in and note the Python version required.
	E.g.	conda search <term>
	    **Note** The search will list all packages which contain that <term>
	
	E.g.	conda search snake
	    One of the many results from that search is: 
		SnakeMake 3.10.1    py35_1  bioconda/linux-64

	This indicates you will need Python version 3.5.1 to run this SnakeMake package.

4) Create your conda environment while include the common packages associated with Anadconda
	E.g	conda create -n nameOfEnv python=3.5.1 anaconda
	
	This creates a new Conda environment, and it uses Python verison 3.5.1

5) Begin by entering, or "activate"ing your conda environment.
	E.g.	source activate <envName>
		source activate py351wSnake

6) Install any addition packages that you may require.
	E.g	conda install <packageName>=<packageVersion>
		conda install snakemake=3.10.1

7) Verify everything worked.... 
	E.g	snakemake --version


8) Running it! You've already gotten your script yes?
	snakemake --jobs 100 --cluster-config cluster.json --drmaa " {cluster.defaultSpec} "
		--jobs 100				Specifices number of jobs
		--cluster-config <fileName>		Specifices name//location of config file
		--drmaa					We are using DRMAA
		" {cluster.defaultSpec} "		This pulls the arguements defaultSpec from cluster.json
			defaultSpec =
