# Snakemake Pipelines Development
This repository has been developed for the purpose of tracking the exploration of 
biological pipelines by leveraging the build-automation software Snakemake.

The language's publication can be found here:
* https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/28/19/2520/290322/Snakemake-a-scalable-bioinformatics-workflow

## Modules:
Snakemake and Python modules are developed and stored here. 

## BuildArea:
Development of pipelines is to occurr here. Can used BuildPipe.py to assist in pipeline development, or
you manually develope a pipeline and include Snakefiles from the Modules directory. 

## condaENV
Configuration files for current and previous CONDA environents are stored here.

## Supporting Docs (Pipeline)
* Presentation - This PowerPoint slideshow was presented to the Lympoid Cancer Research Department during their lab meeting on April 7th, 2017
* PipelineVignette - This MS Word document provides detailed instructions on how to generate a pipeline in the LCR system on our SGE Network.
* ModuleVignette - ***Incomplete - Revised screenshots after minor refactoring*** This MS Word document provides detailed instructions 
on how to generate a module for the LCR pipeline system our SGE Network.


## Archive
Old files that I cannot come to terms deleting but realistically will never need again.
