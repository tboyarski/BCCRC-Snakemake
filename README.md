# Snakemake Pipelines Development
This repository has been developed for the purpose of tracking the exploration of 
biological pipelines by leveraging the build-automation software Snakemake.

The language's publication can be found here:

## Modules:
Snakemake and Python modules are developed and stored here. 

## BuildArea:
Development of pipelines is to occurr here. Can used BuildPipe.py to assist in pipeline development, or
you manually develope a pipeline and include Snakefiles from the Modules directory. 

## condaENV
Configuration files for current and previous CONDA environents are stored here.

## Archive
Old files that I can't come to terms deleting but realistically will never need again.
