# GNU Make
Repository is used to collect and copy makefiles from the core modules directory on Genesis. 
The makefiles are copied because I am adding additional commenting to the makefiles, in order
to better understand them. This will assist when I attempt to re-create some of them in
Snakemake. The files were copied as I wanted to avoid editting the makefiles as some are 
actively being used.
