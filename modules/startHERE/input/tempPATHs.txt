# 1. Running the tumor-normal pair (Pfeiffer1T, Pfeiffer1N; 'sampleFILEpair.txt'):
#   ~ Things to change and *why*:
#       -Change BAM annotation to remove duplicates instead of marking them
#           *BAM processing
#       -Change varScan minimum coverage from 20 to 25.
#           *varScan Parameters
#       -Change varScan chromosome split processing flag from True to False.
#           *Whome genome vs Chromosome processing
#       -Change VCF output file from canonical to noncanonical annotation.
#           *VCF Annotation
#       -Change the JAVA version used by varScan.
#           *software version absolute paths
#       -Change from the default of using biobambam to sort the bam file to using samtools
#           *software choice flags
#
#
# 2. Do it using the same configurations, but run single samples (Pfeiffer2, Pfeiffer3; 'sampleFILEsingle.txt')
